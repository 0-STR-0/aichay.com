## üåê Deploy to Production

### Option 1: Heroku (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
npm install -g heroku

# Login to Heroku
heroku login

# Create app
heroku create your-aichay-app

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
heroku config:set EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Add email notifications"
git push heroku main
```

### Option 2: DigitalOcean/AWS
1. Upload files to your server
2. Install Node.js and npm
3. Run `npm install`
4. Use PM2 to keep server running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js
   pm2 startup
   ```

### Option 3: Vercel/Netlify
These platforms are better for static sites. For email notifications, you'll need a separate backend service.

### Test Email Notifications
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payment-notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orderId": "TEST_123",
    "paymentId": "TEST_PAY_123",
    "amount": "18.98",
    "currency": "KWD",
    "paymentMethod": "PayPal",

  }'
```

## üîí Security Notes

### Production Security

3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to git
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent spam
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data

### Email Security
1. **App Passwords**: Use Gmail App Passwords, not regular passwords
2. **Encryption**: Consider using encrypted email services
3. **Backup**: Keep backup copies of important orders
