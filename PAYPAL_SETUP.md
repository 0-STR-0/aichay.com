<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID&currency=KWD"></script>
```

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

## Step 5: Set Up Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)

1. **In PayPal Developer Dashboard**:
   - Go to "Webhooks"
   - Add webhook URL: `https://yourwebsite.com/paypal-webhook`
   - Select events: `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`

## Step 6: Backend Integration (For Full Functionality)

You'll need a server to:
- Process webhooks from PayPal
- Store order information
- Send confirmation emails
- Handle inventory

### Simple Backend Options:

#### Option 1: Node.js + Express
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/paypal-webhook', (req, res) => {
    // Handle PayPal webhook
    console.log('Payment received:', req.body);
    res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

#### Option 2: Python + Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/paypal-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def paypal_webhook():
    # Handle PayPal webhook
    print('Payment received:', request.json)
    return '', 200
```

#### Option 3: PHP
```php
<?php
// paypal-webhook.php
$webhook_data = file_get_contents('php://input');
$data = json_decode($webhook_data, true);

// Handle the webhook
file_put_contents('orders.log', json_encode($data) . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
?>
```

## Step 7: Legal Requirements

1. **Business Registration**: Register your business legally
2. **Tax ID**: Get appropriate tax identification
3. **Terms of Service**: Add to your website
4. **Privacy Policy**: Add to your website
5. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure your website uses HTTPS
